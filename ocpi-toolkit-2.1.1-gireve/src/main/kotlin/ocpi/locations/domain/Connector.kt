 * @property standard The standard of the installed connector.
 * @property format The format (socket/cable) of the installed connector.
 * @property power_type
 * @property voltage Voltage of the connector (line to neutral for AC_3_PHASE), in volt V.
 * @property amperage maximum amperage of the connector, in ampere A.
