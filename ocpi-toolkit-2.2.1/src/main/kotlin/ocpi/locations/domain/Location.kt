/**
 * The Location object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSEs that belong together are
 * installed. Typically, the Location object is the exact location of the group of EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance
 * of a parking garage which contains these EVSEs. The exact way to reach each EVSE can be further specified by its own
 * properties.
 *

 * EVSEs that may be published and may not be published, two 'Locations' should be created.
